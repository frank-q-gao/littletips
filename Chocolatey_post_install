Having followed the instructions at https://chocolatey.org/install#installing-chocolatey to word, I still got the error when 
running choco with elevated prividges:

This is try 1/3. Retrying after 300 milliseconds.
 Error converted to warning:
 Access to the path 'C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\config' is denied.
This is try 2/3. Retrying after 400 milliseconds.
 Error converted to warning:
 Access to the path 'C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\config' is denied.
Maximum tries of 3 reached. Throwing error.
Cannot create directory "C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\config". Error was:
System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the path 'C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\config' is denied.

Re-open Command Prompt and Powershell, and reboot Windows 10 as per screen prompts and various online resources suggested, none helped. 

To solve, locate "choco" executable in File Explorer, in my case it is located in the c:\ProgramData\chocolatey directory, right-click 
on "choco", select "Run as Administrator" from the context menu. In so doing, choco is able to create config folder and 
chocolatey.config file. 

Choco works like a charm since then.
